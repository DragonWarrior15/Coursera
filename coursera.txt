7000$

My current salary isn't sufficient enough to pay for the courses, but I do want to learn them and improve my professional growth.
Since coursera provides is a way to achieve this through online learning, I want to take this opportunity so that I can learn free of economic burden.

I have a background in python programming and want to extend that skill by learning about how to use python from the perspective of machine learning.
Since python is being deployed for a lot of machine learning tasks today, I think it will be a good skill for me to learn and improve my career.
I have also completed Andrew's machine learning course, and the current course is a natural successor to it.

Once I finish the course, I would like to be a mentor to other people, those who may have difficulty understanding concepts.  This way both of us learn and I get experience in guiding others, which can be a very useful skill for me.
Further, when I find something on the forums which I am not aware of, I can participate in the discussion giving my inputs and helping the community become better.
